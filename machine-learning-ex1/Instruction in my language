See we have different kind of file containing functions

        --------- |     ----- | --------
==                            Warm-up Exercise |  10 /  10 | Nice work!
==           Computing Cost (for One Variable) |   0 /  40 | 
==         Gradient Descent (for One Variable) |   0 /  50 | 
==                       Feature Normalization |   0 /   0 | 
==     Computing Cost (for Multiple Variables) |   0 /   0 | 
==   Gradient Descent (for Multiple Variables) |   0 /   0 | 
==                            Normal Equations |   0 /   0 | 

These are the files

All these file's functions that are defined are utlised in a single file ex1.m
So,we have to go to each file define the function
Now,we have to run ex1 to see whether our program works or not
Then submit
